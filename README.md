# PasswordGenerator 2024 package builder.

This build generates an artifact and 2 exe files.
one lighter Windows app with random password generation, and one with 20 sec load time due to loading of transformes LLM.
<p>
The heavier app has the addition of LLM sentence generation + "scramble", this means that everthing is processed on your own computer.

A Password generator for Windows.

Windows package releses is found [Here](https://github.com/PierreGode/PasswordGenerator/releases)

<p>
NOTE! The package is NOT a signed package and Windows Defender will hate it! so do NOT use at an company's owned computer unless you wish for IT to chase you with pitchforks. 
but the package is perfectly safe to use. ( you can review the build  )
